Is music getting worse? Put me in the camp of those who say yes. To be sure, I only say this about rock, not hip hop or pop. But few would argue that hip hop and pop are getting better. So if rock is worse, then on average all music is worse.

I'm also not claiming that no good rock music is being made today. But if we rank the decades, it can't be a seven-way tie. One of them has to sit at the bottom, and it's hard to imagine it being any decade other than the one we just left.

When I go online to see what others think about the current state of music, those who defend it tend to use the same set of arguments. So I thought I'd provide a rebuttal to each one of them here.

**What kind of sad person would rather say that music is getting worse?**

This one is implied rather than stated. Music is so subjective, the thinking goes, and so whether it's getting worse just depends on your state of mind. If you're a cynic, it's because you choose to be.

But this misunderstands my motive. Why do *I* say that today's music has gotten worse? Because I want us to fix it. Just like you can't fix global warming until you acknowledge that it's happening.

And once you do, no one assumes you're blaming today's youth for all the floods and wildfires today. But talk about musical climate change, and it's the youth who take offense. So let me clear this up. When I say music is getting worse, it's an indictment of my generation. Not theirs.

Previous generations depleted the oceans of all the big fish. And my generation exhausted rock music of any more big names. We broke it, so it's on us to fix it.

**There are more artists doing more things than ever before.**

Yes, but every generation can make this claim. For the indefinite future, in every genre and medium, an ever increasing number of artists will be doing an ever increasing number of things.

And for the past several decades, anyone could have said this about classical or jazz. Yet no one believes these genres are still in the midst of their golden age.

**There was bad music in the past as well.**

Of course. But we rank artists by their hits, not their misses. No one knocks Beethoven down a few pegs because he composed [Wellington's Victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington%27s_Victory).

The same rule applies to entire decades as well. Whatever dreck the 60s came up with, they also gave us the Beatles. Where's today's Beatles?

**There's so much good music out there if you're willing to find it.**

(TODO: 1. elaborate about famous artists of the past)

But this was also true in the past. It wasn't just Nirvana and no one else. There were so many amazing but less popular bands if you cared to look. Yo La Tengo, Slint, Cap'n Jazz, the Promise Ring… to name a few.

Yet few young people today get into these obscure bands from the past. Why would they? They'd rather listen to their own— along with Nirvana. So why would young people tomorrow bother with today's obscure bands? They can just listen to their own as well— along with Nirvana.

(TODO: Present day bands are not good to future fans.)

As someone who grew up listening to music made by people with different values who'd been dead for centuries, I've never understood.

**Every generation has its naysayers.**

Sure, there will always be grumpy old cranks who think the music of their own time was the best. But when your naysayers are young, you have a problem.

Back when I taught music theory, I had a casual chat with my students. Some of them seemed to harbor the hope that music only ever seems epic in retrospect. Maybe every generation before had also failed to appreciate what they had until it was gone?

But then I told them how awesome it was to witness the birth of grunge as it happened. That when all those Seattle bands exploded onto the scene, it felt like we were watching history in the making. The 60s, 70s, and 80s each had their moment to shine, and now it was our turn.

My students were crestfallen.

**What are the chances that something so good for so long would suddenly turn bad in our time?**

What are the chances in *our* time? I don't know. But at *some* point in time? One hundred percent. Because no renaissance ever lasted. Why would rock and roll be any different?

We'd all love to live during a renaissance. Yet throughout history, their absence has been the norm. So you have to assume they can't be willed into being. What's needed is a very fortunate— and very unlikely— set of circumstances.

You also have to assume they're hard to sustain once that fortune runs out. Because every generation born into a renaissance will take it for granted, and eventually one will let it die. Nothing in their lifetime ever taught them that a renaissance requires proper stewardship.

With that said, have you ever heard anyone talk about being a steward of the rock and roll renaissance?

**Measuring music by its timbral variety is a bunch of crock.**

Okay, I agree with the defenders on this one. Yes, research based on analyzing thousands of popular songs over the years has shown that tonal and timbral variety has gone down over time. But by what supreme authority does this actually mean today's music is worse?

Music is too subjective, and so you can't make objective arguments with data analysis. You need systems thinking instead. For example, few would dispute that inefficient systems lead to worse results. Well, the indie system is inefficient by design.

The indie labels only sign artists who've built a fanbase on their own. But a label has leverage while an unknown artist has none. And more leverage gets you better results for the same effort. So in an efficient system, building the fanbase would be a label's job.

Instead, the labels are stuck trying to promote artists who've logged more time chasing a following than developing a craft. This gradually loses them prestige. They're then compelled to find artists who can do even more of their work for them, and the vicious circle continues.

By thinking in systems, we can expect indie music to be worse. Yet for many who defend today's music, the indies are its saving grace!

**Each generation can only be judged by what's possible in its own time.**

Previous generations plucked all the low-hanging fruit. No band as raw as the Sex Pistols can ever again change the world. So the argument here is that today's artists haven't fumbled the ball. The means to start the next revolution are now too high to reach.

But this assumes that we're doing our best to find the revolutionary artists out there. That once they arrive, you'll definitely hear about them. Prove this assumption wrong, and the argument falls apart. So let's do that.

Here's the first part of my rebuttal. In their heyday, the major labels took big risks to discover bands no one knew about, like Radiohead. 

By contrast, the indie labels make safe bets on local bands with an established following. And they've never promised to do anything else.

(TODO: Risk averse.)

The majors have become risk-averse.
But you have to assume that discovering a great band isn't possible without taking big risks.

(TODO: No one's trying to discover next Radiohead. Not the majors, not the indies.)
And so the next Radiohead can never be discovered. Or, more likely, the band that could have been the next Radiohead in some parallel universe, instead does things the indie way. And that's what they pride themselves on, never knowing how much their fate was decided by the system.

(TODO: Yearling's Bobtail. Same time, energy, and skill level in graphic novel, some publisher would have picked it up.)

(TODO: I'm not saying. YB is the canary in the coalmine.)

The indies themselves don't claim to be better.
